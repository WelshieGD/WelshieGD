- 👋 Hi, I’m @WelshieGD - Graham, born in that very Welsh province of Singapore. A long suffering supporter of Welsh rugby through the lows, the very lows and then the Gatland years. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things automation, monitoring, observability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# to help with my PowerShell scripting.

Background:
- Mid-1990's - My early introduction to IT and my first set of certifications - MCSE (NT4), MCDBA (SQL7) and MCSD (Visual Basic).
- The turn of the century - From Training to Implementation - An Implementation Engineer at NetIQ for their enterprise monitoring solution - NetIQ AppManager. NetIQ then acquires Mission Critical Software and I'm suddenly become an Implementation Engineer for NetIQ Operations Manager
- 2000 onwards - NetIQ Operations Manager becomes Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM 2000 \ MOM 2005 \ SCOM 2007 etc.)
- I rode the Microsoft MOM \ SCOM wave for 20 years at a Microsoft Gold Partner (where I was an MVP in Cloud and Datacenter Management), at Microsoft as a Senior Premier Field Engineer and then at the UK central Bank.
